# Metadata Project:Metadata Search Engine (MetaHub DB)â€¯ 

 
## Project Overview: 
Our team, consisting of three members, undertook the task of building a metadata search engine as part of the for the Metadata course. The primary objective of the project was to create a search engine capable of processing various file types (Images, Mp3, PPT and PDF), extracting metadata, and storing it in a MySQL database. 
 
### User stories 
New user stories may be added or old ones removed by the product owner, but these are the ones we currently have: 
- As a system owner, I want a MySQL database that can effectively store metadata about various types of files so that I can search for a file through a metadata search. 

- As a system owner, I want a system that can extract metadata from folders of files and save the metadata related to file names/paths in the database. 

 As a system owner, I want a MySQL database that can effectively store metadata about web pages/URLs so that I can search for a webpage through a metadata search. (Hold off on this user story until a review of scraping/harvesting data from web pages is done in week 49.) 

As a visitor, I want a web-based interface for searching metadata so that it is easy for me to search and view results. 

 As a visitor, I want to be able to choose what I want to search (a specific file type or web pages) so that the system understands the type of data I want to search for. 

As a visitor, I want to be able to search both by file name and metadata so that I can easily find what I'm looking for. 

 As a visitor, I want to be able to search effectively in the metadata (e.g., if something is equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than) a certain value, so that it is easy for me to refine my search. 

 As a visitor, I want to be able to search geographically when the metadata contains geographic information (latitude and longitude). 

 As a visitor and system owner, I want the system to have a set of test data (non-copyright protected) so that I can test that the system functions as intended. 

 

 

Technologies Used: 

Node.js: Employed for metadata extraction from files and web pages using relevant libraries and plugins. 

MySQL: Chosen as the cloud-based server for storing extracted metadata. 

Git (GitHub): Utilized for version control to facilitate collaborative development. 

 

 

Team Collaboration: 

Communication: 

We established clear communication channels using Teams, ensuring effective information exchange and prompt issue resolution. 

 

 

 

Project Management: 

Jira (Kanban) was employed for task organization, progress tracking, and task assignment. This tool helped us maintain clarity on project timelines and individual responsibilities. 

 

 

 

Code Collaboration: 

We adopted a feature branch strategy using Git. Each team member worked on a specific feature in a separate branch before merging into the main branch. Code reviews were regularly conducted to ensure code quality. 

 

Meetings: 

Regular team meetings were scheduled to discuss progress, challenges, and coordinate tasks. These meetings fostered a collaborative environment and allowed for quick problem resolution. 

 

Project Management and Individual Contributions: 

During the project, effective project management was crucial for coordinating tasks, tracking progress, and assigning responsibilities. We employed Jira(Kanban) to streamline these processes and ensure a well-organized development workflow. Each team member had specific roles and responsibilities within the project: 

 
 

MohammadReza Abedi: As the project manager, I took the lead in mapping out the project. This involved overseeing the overall project structure, coordinating task assignments, and ensuring alignment with project timelines. 

Yinghua Zhu: Ingwa played a crucial role in sourcing and collecting relevant materials. Their contribution was instrumental in gathering the necessary information for the project's implementation. 

Shiva Paknegar: Shiva took charge of collecting coding patterns essential for our development tasks. Their role was pivotal in establishing a foundation for our coding practices. 

Meetings and Collaboration: Regular team meetings provided a platform for collective decision-making. During these sessions, we drew conclusions on how to integrate resources and connect them to the established coding patterns. Collective participation and testing on models allowed us to refine our approach. 

 

Throughout the process, Reza took on the responsibility of ensuring that the collected sources aligned seamlessly with the designated implementation patterns. This quality check was crucial for maintaining consistency in our work. 

The collaborative efforts of the team members in their respective roles, combined with the use of Jira(Kanban), contributed significantly to maintaining clarity on project timelines and individual responsibilities.
