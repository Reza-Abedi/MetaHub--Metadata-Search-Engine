# Metadata Search Engineâ€¯(Group3) 
`We would like to note that all final project files are located in the`**'sharedFiles'** `directory, and the server should be run from the`**' /root directory'** ` using the command `**'node server.js'**
 
## Project Overview 
Our team, consisting of three members, undertook the task of building a metadata search engine as part of the for the Metadata course. The primary objective of the project was to create a search engine capable of processing various file types (Images, Mp3, PPT and PDF), extracting metadata, and storing it in a MySQL database. 
 
### User stories 
- As a system owner, I want to have a MySQL database that can effectively store metadata about different types of files so that it's possible to search for a file through a search in the metadata.
- As a system owner, I want there to be a system that can extract metadata about files from folders and save the metadata related to file names/path in the database.
- As a visitor, I want there to be a web-based interface for searching in the metadata so that it's easy for me to search and see results.
- As a visitor, I want to be able to choose what I want to search (a specific file type) so that the system understands the type of data I want to search for.
- As a visitor, I want to be able to search both by file name and different metadata so that I can easily find what I am looking for.
- As a visitor, I want to be able to search in the metadata in a good way (e.g., if something is equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than) a certain value so that it's easy for me to refine my search.
- As a visitor, I want to be able to search geographically when the metadata contains geographic information (latitude and longitude).
- As a visitor and system owner, I want the system to have a set of test data (non-copyright-protected) so that I can test that the system is functioning as it should.

## Database Report: MetaHub

### Database Structure:

- **Images Table:**
  - `imageId` (INT): Auto-incremented primary key for image identification.
  - `imageName` (VARCHAR(100)): Unique name of the image.
  - `imageDescription` (JSON): JSON data structure for storing image metadata.

- **PowerPoints Table:**
  - `pptId` (INT): Auto-incremented primary key for PowerPoint identification.
  - `pptName` (VARCHAR(100)): Unique name of the PowerPoint.
  - `pptDescription` (JSON): JSON data structure for storing PowerPoint metadata.

- **Musics Table:**
  - `musicId` (INT): Auto-incremented primary key for music identification.
  - `musicName` (VARCHAR(100)): Unique name of the music.
  - `musicDescription` (JSON): JSON data structure for storing music metadata.

- **PDFs Table:**
  - `pdfId` (INT): Auto-incremented primary key for PDF identification.
  - `pdfName` (VARCHAR(100)): Unique name of the PDF.
  - `pdfDescription` (JSON): JSON data structure for storing PDF metadata.

**Explanation:**
The database employs a common structure for each content type, with a unique identifier (`Id`), a name field (`Name`) to ensure uniqueness, and a `Description` field stored as JSON to accommodate various metadata attributes associated with each type of content.

# Extract and Insert Metadata into MetaHub Database 

**Note:** The source files for extract files are expected to be located in the `2-Metadata_Extraction` folder. 
This folder contains code snippets written in JavaScript to extract metadata from various types of digital content (images, music files, PDFs, and PowerPoints) and insert them into the MetaHub database.

**Image Metadata Extraction:** The code utilizes the `exifr` library to parse EXIF data from JPEG images. Extracted metadata is then inserted into the MetaHub database's Images table, storing information such as image name and description in JSON format.

**Music Metadata Extraction:**
For music files, the `music-metadata` library is employed to extract metadata. Unnecessary metadata fields are removed before inserting relevant information, including music name and description, into the MetaHub Musics table.

**PDF Metadata Extraction:**
The code uses the `pdf-parse-fork` library to extract metadata, including the number of pages and additional information, from PDF files. The extracted data, along with the full text, is inserted into the MetaHub PDFs table.

**PowerPoint Metadata Insertion:**
PowerPoint metadata stored in a JSON file is read and processed. Unnecessary fields are removed, and the remaining metadata is inserted into the MetaHub PowerPoints table.

**Database Connection:**
A MySQL database connection is established using the `mysql2` library, with a connection pool for efficient handling of database connections. The connection details, including host, port, user, password, and database name, are specified in the code.
