  <p>Welcome to the MetaHub Dashboard! Use the navigation menu above to explore different metadata types.</p>

    <h2>User Stories</h2>
 
    <ol>
      <li>As a system owner, I want to have a MySQL database that can effectively store metadata about different types of files so that it's possible to search for a file through a search in the metadata.</li>
 
      <li>As a system owner, I want there to be a system that can extract metadata about files from folders and save the metadata related to file names/path in the database.</li>
 
      <li>As a visitor, I want there to be a web-based interface for searching in the metadata so that it's easy for me to search and see results.</li>
 
      <li>As a visitor, I want to be able to choose what I want to search (a specific file type) so that the system understands the type of data I want to search for.</li>
 
      <li>As a visitor, I want to be able to search both by file name and different metadata so that I can easily find what I am looking for.</li>
 
      <li>As a visitor, I want to be able to search in the metadata in a good way (e.g., if something is equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than) a certain value so that it's easy for me to refine my search.</li>
 
      <li>As a visitor, I want to be able to search geographically when the metadata contains geographic information (latitude and longitude).</li>
 
      <li>As a visitor and system owner, I want the system to have a set of test data (non-copyright-protected) so that I can test that the system is functioning as it should.</li>
